    <h1>Client-Friendly Market Summary – February 3, 2026</h1>

    <p>The market is a little uneasy to start the week because a lot of attention is on jobs data.

Even though headlines say the job market is strong, the reality is more mixed. Many people who lose work today don’t show up in the usual reports — especially freelancers, gig workers, and people whose unemployment benefits have run out. That means job numbers can look better on paper than they feel in real life.

When economists look deeper, they’re seeing signs that more people are staying unemployed longer, even if that doesn’t show up in the main headlines yet.

Some Fed officials are openly acknowledging this. One Fed governor recently said the job market is weaker than it appears and that interest rates may still be too high for where the economy is right now.

That’s why this week’s job reports matter so much. If they confirm the slowdown, it could help calm markets and support housing conditions as the year moves forward.</p>
