        <p><strong>Mary Ann:</strong></p>
        <p>I am posting this on a beautiful morning from my patio looking out at the green pastures of my new farm. This farm is a lifelong dream and Kristy Flach at PRMG played a very significant role in making that happen! My search for a farm presented several challenges and Kristy stuck with me through the whole crazy process. Crazy being from the sellers, the loan process was nothing but smooth sailing. I honestly felt like I was her only client. She was always there if I needed questions answered or to talk me off the ledge, so to speak, when I was anxious. Several times she talked with me after hours and got moving on things early in the morning. She handheld me through the entire process from the first property I put in an offer to the 3rd which I closed on last week, and is exactly what I wanted. I would absolutely refer anyone to Kristy. I've been singing her praises all over town. She is top notch! And I feel like I've also made a friend in the process. Thanks, Kristy, for all your help, I would not be at my dream farm without you!</p>
