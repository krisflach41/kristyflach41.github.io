  <h1>Conventional Loan Guide</h1>

  <div class="loan-card">
    <h2>What Is a Conventional Loan?</h2>
    <p>Conventional home loans are the most common type of mortgage in the country. These loans are not insured or guaranteed by the government, unlike FHA and VA loans. Lenders offer conventional loans with varying terms and interest rates, and borrowers typically need to have good credit and a stable income to qualify.</p>
    <p>Conventional loans can be used to purchase primary residences, second homes, or investment properties. They also offer the flexibility of choosing between fixed or adjustable interest rates.</p>
    <p>While conventional loans may require a higher down payment than government-backed loans, they often have lower interest rates and fewer fees. Additionally, borrowers can avoid mortgage insurance if they put down at least 20% of the home’s purchase price.</p>
    <p>Overall, conventional home loans are a popular choice for those who meet the qualifications and want to own a home without government involvement.</p>

    <h2>How to Qualify for a Conventional Loan</h2>
    <p>Preapproval is the first and most important step toward acquiring your Conventional Loan. Whether you’re a first-time home buyer or seeking to refinance your current home, getting preapproved helps narrow your focus to properties that fit your budget, establish credibility with sellers, and expedites both the loan funding and closing process.</p>

    <h2>Requirements for Refinancing into a Conventional Loan</h2>
    <p>Refinancing into a conventional home loan can help reduce monthly payments, secure a lower rate, switch from adjustable to fixed, shorten the mortgage term, or access home equity for other financial goals.</p>
