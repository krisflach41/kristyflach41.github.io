  <!-- 3 MARKET SUMMARY -->
  <div class="brief-block">
  <h3>Today’s Market Summary</h3>

  <p><strong>Market Tone:</strong> Cautious, with attention turning toward signs of labor market softening.</p>

  <p>Stocks and Mortgage Bonds are both lower to start the week as markets head into a critical stretch of labor data. While the public narrative still describes the labor market as “strong,” several underlying indicators suggest conditions may be weaker than headline numbers imply.</p>

  <p>Initial jobless claims, often used as proof of labor strength, are becoming less reliable. They do not fully capture displaced self-employed workers, gig workers, individuals unable to survive on unemployment benefits, and some immigrant workers hesitant to file. As a result, job losses may be underreported and the unemployment rate may not reflect true labor conditions.</p>

  <p>Continuing claims present a similar distortion. Although the headline figure sits near 1.89 million, it excludes individuals whose benefits have expired. When including those unemployed for more than 27 weeks, the total rises to roughly 3.84 million — indicating meaningful deterioration beneath the surface.</p>

  <p>This perspective aligns with recent comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who dissented at the last Fed meeting and supported a 25 basis point rate cut. Waller argues policy remains restrictive, the labor market is weaker than commonly believed, and job growth in 2025 is tracking far below long-term averages, with revisions potentially pushing net job creation close to zero.</p>

  <p>On inflation, Waller believes tariffs are contributing significantly to recent price pressures. Removing those effects brings inflation trends closer to the Fed’s 2% target. Combined with softening labor conditions, this supports the case for earlier policy easing.</p>

  <p>Markets now turn to this week’s labor reports — beginning with JOLTS — to determine whether evidence of labor softening continues to build, which could be supportive for mortgage rates if confirmed.</p>

  <!-- 4 CLIENT FRIENDLY -->
  <div class="brief-block highlight">
  <h3>Client-Friendly Market Summary</h3>

  <p>The market is a little uneasy to start the week because a lot of attention is on upcoming jobs data.</p>

  <p>Even though headlines often say the job market is strong, the reality is more mixed. Many people who lose work today don’t show up in the usual reports — especially freelancers, gig workers, and people whose unemployment benefits have run out. That means job numbers can look better on paper than they feel in real life.</p>

  <p>When economists look deeper, they’re seeing signs that more people are staying unemployed longer, even if that doesn’t show up in the main headlines yet.</p>

  <p>Some Fed officials are openly acknowledging this. One Fed governor recently noted that the job market may be weaker than it appears and that interest rates could still be too high for where the economy is right now.</p>

  <p>That’s why this week’s job reports matter so much. If they confirm a slowdown, it could help calm markets and support housing conditions as the year moves forward.</p>
