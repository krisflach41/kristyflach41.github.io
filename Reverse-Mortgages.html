<h1>Reverse Mortgage Guide</h1>

<div class="loan-card">
  <h2>What Is a Reverse Mortgage?</h2>
  <p>Reverse mortgage loans offer a unique opportunity for eligible homeowners to tap into the equity in their homes without the need to make monthly payments. With a reverse mortgage, individuals aged 62 or older can leverage the equity in their homes to pay off or refinance their current mortgage, or purchase a new home.</p>
  <p>The amount that can be borrowed is based on several factors, including the value of the home, the borrower’s age, and the interest rate at the time of borrowing.</p>
  <p>Unlike traditional loans, repayment of the loan is only required when the borrower no longer occupies the property as their primary residence or if they pass away.</p>
  <p>Eligible non-borrowing spouses can even continue living in the home and accessing benefits as long as they meet their specific loan’s obligations, such as property maintenance, taxes, or related expenses.</p>
  <p>If you’re interested in learning more about how a reverse mortgage could benefit you, PRMG’s Home Mortgage Professionals can provide you with the information and resources you need to make an informed decision about your financial future.</p>

  <h2>What Is HECM for Purchase?</h2>
  <p>HECM for Purchase, also referred to as a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage for Purchase, is a government-insured loan that enables eligible borrowers to purchase a new home by utilizing reverse mortgage loan proceeds.</p>
  <p>This solution allows homeowners to leverage equity from their current home to acquire a new property in a single transaction, simplifying loan costs and eliminating the need for monthly mortgage payments.</p>
  <p>Borrowers must be at least 62 years old (one non-borrowing spouse may be younger), own the property, live in the home as their primary residence, complete HUD-approved counseling, and have sufficient funds for the required down payment.</p>
  <p>HECM for Purchase empowers eligible borrowers to increase buying power, move closer to family, transition to senior communities, right-size, and preserve retirement assets while potentially eliminating monthly mortgage payments.</p>

<div class="loan-card">
  <h2>What Is a Jumbo Reverse Mortgage?</h2>
  <p>Jumbo reverse mortgage loans offer borrowers greater access to home equity than the federally insured HECM lending limit allows. Also known as proprietary reverse mortgages, these privately funded loans provide an alternative to standard HECM programs.</p>
  <p>Jumbo reverse mortgages pay off your existing mortgage and allow access to remaining home equity, with proceeds available as a lump sum, line of credit, or regular payments.</p>
  <p>Some proprietary products allow borrowers as young as 55, owning high-value property with substantial equity, to qualify after financial assessment and HUD counseling.</p>
  <p>Loan proceeds can reach up to $4 million depending on property value, borrower age, and interest rates.</p>
  <p>At PRMG, our Home Mortgage Professionals guide homeowners through the Jumbo Reverse Mortgage process to develop customized solutions aligned with financial goals.</p>
